# finalProjectEmulator

Use "make 'game'.nes" to run a game (requires SDL2), or "./emulator.exe 'game'.nes"
Available games are under the game_ROMs folder. Save data is also stored there once you generate it.
Use WASD for d-pad inputs, T/Y for Select/Start, and K/L for B/A. Player 2 controls as well as any rebindings can be done through the macros in "controller.cpp"
Use Space to see the rendering process, and P to see the pattern tables.
