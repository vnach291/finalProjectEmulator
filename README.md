# finalProjectEmulator

Use "make 'game'.nes" to build the emulator and run a game (requires SDL2), or "./emulator.exe 'game'.nes" to just run a game.

Some games have already been included under the game_ROMs folder. Save data is also stored there once you generate it.

Use WASD for d-pad inputs, T/Y for Select/Start, and K/L for B/A. Player 2 controls as well as any rebindings can be done in "controller.cpp" throug its macros.

Use Space to see the rendering process, and P to see the pattern tables.
